# Main Street Marketplace Toolkit

**Open, non-proprietary marketplace intelligence for U.S. small businesses.**

`msmt` is a Python toolkit that translates the kind of analytics enterprise
marketplaces use internally — listing integrity, supply resilience, demand
forecasting with practitioner guardrails — into transparent, auditable
modules that an SBDC counselor, a state commerce program analyst, a niche
marketplace operator, or an SMB seller can run on their own laptop.

It is a companion to the **Main Street Marketplace** article series, a
five-part, plain-language walk-through of the same ideas:

- Part 4 — [Forecasts Fail Quietly](https://medium.com/@ayush.tripathi955/article-4-forecasts-fail-quietly-359cef729bdc)
- Part 5 — [Marketplace Concentration Risk](https://medium.com/@ayush.tripathi955/article-5-marketplace-concentration-risk-1d7af1908550)

There is no commercial version of this toolkit and no paid tier. It is MIT
licensed, free forever, and intentionally built from public methods and
synthetic data so anyone can read, run, and adapt it without asking
permission.

## Who this is for

- **SBDC counselors** advising small marketplace sellers who want a
  defensible, explainable view of demand and inventory risk.
- **State and regional commerce program staff** evaluating where small
  sellers are most exposed to marketplace volatility.
- **Niche marketplace operators** (regional, industry-vertical, or co-op
  marketplaces) who need ideas that scale down to a few hundred SKUs.
- **SMB sellers** on Amazon, Walmart, eBay, Shopify, Etsy, or any
  comparable platform who want to reason about their own data without
  handing it to a black-box vendor.
- **Policy researchers** studying small-business resilience in
  digital commerce.

## The three pillars

The toolkit is organized around three problems every marketplace seller
runs into, regardless of size:

1. **Marketplace integrity** (`msmt.integrity`) — Score a seller against
   ten fulfillment, post-purchase, and content signals; surface
   suppression risk and the top issues to fix. Includes a catalog
   concentration audit using the DOJ Herfindahl-Hirschman thresholds.
2. **Supply resilience** (`msmt.resilience`) — Classify each SKU's
   demand pattern, compute safety stock and reorder points, and rank
   the catalog by current stockout risk — including the platform
   suppression tail.
3. **Forecasting with guardrails** (`msmt.forecasting`) — Auto-select a
   forecasting method per SKU (six baselines, Croston for intermittent
   demand, Prophet for holiday-spike SKUs with a numpy fallback) and
   wrap the result in five plain-language guardrails that tell a
   counselor when to trust it.

Shared utilities live under `msmt.data` (synthetic data generation).

## Running the app

The toolkit ships with an interactive Streamlit app that exposes all
three modules to a non-technical audience — the primary artifact for
SBDC counselors, state commerce program staff, and SMB sellers who
don't want to read Python:

```bash
pip install -e ".[app,forecasting]"
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

Then open the URL Streamlit prints (typically `http://localhost:8501`)
and pick a module from the sidebar. Every page runs on synthetic data
generated in-memory; the app does not read or write any files and does
not call any external APIs.

The four pages mirror the modules:

* **Home** — what each pillar does, with links into the modules.
* **Marketplace Integrity** — score a demo seller or enter your own
  metrics; see the scorecard, top issues, recommendations, and a
  catalog concentration audit.
* **Supply Resilience** — generate a synthetic catalog, see the
  stockout-risk heatmap, and use the platform-suppression cost
  calculator.
* **Demand Forecasting** — pick a demand pattern, see the auto-
  selected method's forecast and 95% prediction interval, and watch
  the five guardrails fire (or not).

> Screenshot placeholder — running the app locally and taking
> screenshots of each page is the recommended next step.

## Deployment

The repo is set up for two independent deployments — the interactive
Streamlit app and the standalone landing page — both free.

### Streamlit Community Cloud (the app)

The app is configured for one-click deployment to
[Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io):

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io) and connect
   your GitHub account.
2. Select this repo (`main-street-marketplace-toolkit`), branch `main`,
   main file `app/streamlit_app.py`.
3. The included `requirements.txt` (which installs the `msmt` package
   directly from this GitHub repo via `git+https://...`) and
   `.streamlit/config.toml` (theme + headless server) are picked up
   automatically.
4. Streamlit builds and deploys; the app goes live at a
   `*.streamlit.app` URL.
5. To use a custom subdomain (e.g. `app.mainstreetmarketplace.org`),
   add it under *Settings → Custom domain* in your Streamlit Cloud app
   settings and point a CNAME record at the URL Streamlit gives you.

### Static landing page (mainstreetmarketplace.org)

The `website/` folder is a self-contained static site. No build step,
no JavaScript framework, no Node toolchain.

* **Vercel** — `npx vercel deploy website/`, or connect the GitHub
  repo via [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and set the root
  directory to `website/`.
* **Netlify** — drag the `website/` folder onto
  [netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop), or connect the
  repo and set the publish directory to `website/`.
* **GitHub Pages** — set the Pages source to the `main` branch with
  the `/website` folder.

After the static site is live, point `mainstreetmarketplace.org`'s
DNS A or CNAME record at the deployed host.

## Walkthrough notebooks

For readers who want to see the toolkit run end-to-end in code, the
`notebooks/` folder ships four walkthroughs:

* `01_marketplace_integrity_walkthrough.ipynb`
* `02_supply_resilience_walkthrough.ipynb`
* `03_forecasting_guardrails_walkthrough.ipynb`
* `04_end_to_end_case_study.ipynb` — the capstone: a single 50-SKU
  synthetic catalog runs through all three modules to produce a
  combined SMB diagnostic report.

All notebooks ship pre-executed so they render with charts on GitHub.

## Quickstart

Install from source (a PyPI release will come once the API stabilizes):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushtripathi955/main-street-marketplace-toolkit.git
cd main-street-marketplace-toolkit
pip install -e .
```

The library itself only depends on `pandas` and `numpy`. Optional
extras pull in the rest of the stack only if you need them:

* `pip install -e ".[forecasting]"` — Prophet and statsforecast for
  holiday-spike forecasting.
* `pip install -e ".[notebooks]"` — Jupyter and matplotlib for the
  walkthrough notebooks.
* `pip install -e ".[app]"` — Streamlit and matplotlib for the
  interactive app.
* `pip install -e ".[test]"` — pytest for the test suite.

Generate a synthetic multi-SKU dataset:

```python
from msmt.data import generate_seller_data

df = generate_seller_data(n_skus=50, n_days=365, seed=42)
print(df.head())
print(df["pattern"].value_counts())
```

You will get a tidy, daily DataFrame with the columns `date`, `sku_id`,
`units_sold`, `listing_price`, `stock_on_hand`, `lead_time_days`,
`category`, and `pattern`. Feed any column into your own analysis — the
rest of the toolkit will use this exact schema.

Need a single SKU of one specific archetype (handy for unit tests or
worked examples)?

```python
from msmt.data import (
    generate_smooth,
    generate_weekly_seasonal,
    generate_holiday_spike,
    generate_intermittent,
    generate_new_sku,
)

steady = generate_smooth(n_days=180, seed=0)
seasonal = generate_weekly_seasonal(n_days=180, seed=0)
holiday = generate_holiday_spike(n_days=365, seed=0, end_date="2025-12-31")
lumpy = generate_intermittent(n_days=365, seed=0)
brand_new = generate_new_sku(n_days=180, history_days=30, seed=0)
```

Every generator accepts a `seed`, so the same arguments always return
the same DataFrame.

## A note on the data

**All data produced by this toolkit is synthetic.** It is not derived
from, sampled from, or modeled on any proprietary or real-world seller
dataset. The five demand archetypes are well-known patterns from the
public operations-research and demand-forecasting literature; the
generators here are simple, transparent implementations meant to make
the rest of the toolkit demonstrable end-to-end without anyone needing
to share their real numbers.

If you want to run `msmt` against your own data, just match the
schema — the column names listed in the quickstart are all the toolkit
expects.

sellers take for granted, in a form anyone can read, run, and trust.
